container-tools: Bugs
=====================


1. veth not removed on container stop
-------------------------------------

When stopping a container, it irregularly but reproducibly happen that the
corresponding veth device of the container is not shutdown, making it
impossible to start the container again.

This is caused by a kernel bug not cleaning up veth devices on container
collapsing. The veth device is supposed to be go away automatically after
some time, definitely after a reboot though.

A manual workaround is to shutdown the veth device manually with:

# ip link delete ${VETH_DEVICE}

There is a patch for it, see for more information:
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/containers/2012-October/030533.html

FIXME: add nspan message about it here

2. bug with machine.slices etc
------------------------------

FIXME

3. veth length
--------------

systemd creates veth devices on the fly and names them vb-$NAME, where NAME is the
container name truncated to the first 10 characters.

Problem: if you have several containers named with the first 10 characters to be
identical, systemd will not be able to create a new veth device.
